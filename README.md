## Calculate display info like DPI and aspect ratio

Input a few simple details and figure out the aspect ratio, DPI, and other details of any display. Great for deciding which laptop or external monitor to purchase, and if it would be considered HiDPI.

Handy features:
- Find out if a display is a good choice based on its size and resolution
- Get advice about different densities
- Differentiation between laptops and desktop displays
- Stupid simple: all in a cute li'l window

Planned features:
- Projector-specific mode
