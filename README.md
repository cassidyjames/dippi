# Dippi

## Calculate display info like DPI and aspect ratio

Analyze any display. Input a few simple details and figure out the aspect ratio, DPI, and other details of a particular display. Great for deciding which laptop or external monitor to purchase, and if it would be considered HiDPI.

### Handy features:

- Find out if a display is a good choice based on its size and resolution
- Get advice about different densities
- Learn the logical resolution
- Differentiate between laptops and desktop displays
- Stupid simple: all in a cute li'l window

Based my expertise and experience shipping HiDPI hardware and software at System76 and elementary.

### Tells you if a display’s density is:

- Very Low DPI,
- Fairly Low DPI,
- Ideal for LoDPI,
- Potentially Problematic,
- Ideal for HiDPI,
- Fairly High for HiDPI, or
- Too High DPI

## Developing and Building

If you want to hack on and build Dippi yourself, I recommend using GNOME Builder. Clone the repository, then just* hit run!

<small>*If you're hitting issues, try "Update project dependencies" in the top-center build menu to ensure you have the SDK installed.</small>
